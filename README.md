# Funky-remi-mix-

The JSON file has been added, but I've also attached an MP3 of what my final project sounds like! :)

My music piece was created on TunePad, remixing a mix of jazz-pop and house music. 

Merged 2 different genres into one piece. This was my goal in trying to foster connections through the enjoyment of music, enabling a wider group of people to enjoy together with people having various tastes in music.
